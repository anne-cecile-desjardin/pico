> Said differently, its design principles can be as much helpful as a way to guide practice in a specific situation, as it can be used as a device to help surface systemic issues in the relationship between computer technology and ecology.

### üè† [Homepage](Create low-power systems that strengthens the biosphere and use the wide-area network sparingly. Minimize the use of artificial energy, fossil fuels and mineral resources. Don't create systems that obfuscate waste.)

### ‚ú® [Demo](In permacomputing contexts, the Yin-Yang dichotomy is sometimes used to contrast different computing cultures. Modern technological civilization is disproportionally yang, and this yangness extends to the cultures of computer hacking: total control over systems (natural or technological) is praised, which easily leads to impoverished monocultures where a lot of energy is wasted on forcing things into narrow standards.)
